Today was a small win, I implemented my plan properly. Gained some confidence by having a good progression on my current projects.    

I had a productive day compared to yesterday. The maker's schedule really worked out, I avoided any interruptions and chose one task for a 2 hours span. Along with that, I dropped trying to multitask. As decided on Day 2, I gave good time to both of my projects.        

## today's read - A Guide To Seed Fundraising (Y Combinator) & Surviving As An Indie (GDC)

Woke up at a decent time today. I tend to avoid consuming content which is not of my use at the time being but don't know why I decided to read something realted to my aspirations. Got reference to this blog post by [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) from an online community, went over to read this. Must say, it was really insightful and very simple to understand. Reading about all the Financing Options for a startup made me feel enlightened when leaving the room. Will continue tomorrow from where I left it, that is "Financing Options".     

Moreover, I spent about 30-40 minutes [on this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmwbYl6f11c&t=2126s) by [Jake Brikett](https://twitter.com/GreyAlien) where he explains how he survived as an Indie (independent, without working for a company and building your own product) Game developer without shipping a major hit. This video made me research more about him and got to know about his non-profit organisation [Full Indie](http://www.fullindie.co.uk/) & [Grey Alien Games](http://www.greyaliengames.com/). Didn't focused much on the tactics shared by Jake but looked at that Indie enthusiasm and trying to understand the mindset. Earlier I thought Indies thrive for building a billion dollar product but it's the other way around. The goal with each product is to ship something that pays for their coffee & accessories and add up to the experience. The key to a hit product is serial development.      

### if(code === "runs successfully"){confidence++}

Finally, I am feeling confident enough to work on Shanc's codebase. TS isn't that weird, I am gradually understanding it's importance and the code written in it. We are planning for a Version 2 launch and the part I am working on is one of the key elements so have to try my level best to make the user experience flawless.      

Had some good progression with the ecommerce site as well. I will try to double down the time on both of the project and avoid procrastinating.      

These days I am able to network with really good people. It's working like a chain, I connect with someone experienced in my domain, they introduce me to another great folks. The good part is people in tech are extremely collaborative and humble. I am literally be able to get on calls with such people, thanks to the internet.       

## learnings

- In the GDC talk I mentioned above, Jake points that beginners should learn to say yes. I can't remember the source but I read somewhere that people early in their career say must yes to every opportunity that teach them something putting monetary benefits aside.
- A tweet I read this day adviced starters to work with people they admire and be selective about the projects they go into. I am glad, I am doing the same and will be able to put my 100% focus on learning once the new laptop is here.         

I would say, today I worked properly but didn't read much instead spent that time procrastinating on Instagram. Would make sure to cut off from memes and read more.
