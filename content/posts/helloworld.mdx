Growing up, I have been reading about people like Elon Musk and Steve Jobs, it became so obvious for me to thrive for living an extraordinary life and think of doing something big. Opposite seemed to be so boring.

### Back Story

Realising, passion is something valued so much. I started looking for what I am obsessed with since I was 12. 
- Not sure what to do, I tried out starting a youtube channel back in the end of 2017. Initially, I made videos on some DIYs and so-called-scientific-stuff. While doing some DIYs, I got introduced to Arduino, my first interaction with technology. I was amazed. You connect some wires, write some code and stuff turns awesome.
- Soon fed up, I thought of doing something entrepreneurial. Watching videos of programming prodigies on youtube, I decided to build an app. With 7-10 days of hard coding, doing everything manually. I added a food recipe app with Cordova framework in Javascript. I wrote no/very less JS, it was a bit confusing and summed a static data app using html and css. It was 2018 when I published the app on Amazon Appstore as it was free. When the app was finally live, I thought of giving a launch party as well, didn't. Got a couple of downloads. Felt building a single app and thinking for it to flourish is a dumb idea. I gotta do more. Bored.
- Tech attracted me. Not sure, how exactly I have to learn to code and where to start, basic problem. I tried doing something else. This time, writing a book. I was just exploring what I love, sci-fi & tech and I decided to simplify some concepts like quantum physics (what I knew), bionic humans, etc. and portray them in a 30-35 pages short book. I wrote the book on paper in just 36 hours. I made a MS Word document laying down the content with an image on each chapter and 11 chapters in total, all covering different topics in concise. I named it "Dynamism", "World has evoloved, have you?". Other day I ran towards a local b&w print shop and got 5 copies printed. All this process in just 4 days. I sold all those to my friends and family. Made about 100 of net profit, selling each at INR. 30. Repeating the process for 2-3 times, getting famous around Papa's colleagues, easy life. Made INR. 600 till then. Now, it felt quite awkward to sell manually stitched b&w books. I went on internet, researched about publishing, read a lot and found about some publishing house that gives some revenue when my book will be sold from their platform. I submitted my book on Notion Press. Got published, bought 4-5 author copies from my profits and buuhhh... company's shut. Nothing got sold anymore. After that, I tried blogging a bit but it wasn't fun anymore and ended up with these writings & content related things in the mid of 2019.
- I thought getting back to technology, now. Took arduino out and started tinkering with it, learnt different stuff but I needed extra hardware to build more and that required money. Umm.. I spent some time reading articles telling about earning as a developer. Found freelancing is a way to do, this was just 2-3 months after I heard this word for the first time. I went on fiverr and searched if anyone is actually providing arduino programming services. Stoked, I found some people doing it! I researched about fiverr rankings & SEO and made a gig. It was stuck, I tried making another gig of building chatbots. Yo, I got a client who paid $15 for a facebook chatbot, I built it. I made my first money online. Previously, it took me immense hardwork to make around 600 INR. and now it was just sitting in my room and doing something with internet. It was fun. I did multiple projects till February 2020 and made 15k INR., bought something, was left with 12k. Did a good amount of arduino projects. Bored once again with the same kind of work.
- Fresh out of Arduino and NodeMCU, I tried building an IOT product by learning web development. Didn't knew this will turn out to be that interesting. I decided to move all into coding. As my 10th board exams got over, I started programming 7-8 hours a day, straight. I was loving it. To validate my learnings, I decided to do some commercial projects, probably working for some client or at a good company. Not so soon enough, I found a startup & directly messaged their founder. Described my skills & projects, got a take home project, did it well and got an internship there. I did that internship for 2 months and ended up earning a certificate with some monetary perks. I got obsessed with working in tech and started understanding how things work here, too.
- Realising, I need to upgrade my system from just a laptop with 2 gigs of RAM to something bearable. I am interested in game development, 3D stuff, machine learning, etc. all this needed better hardware. I decided to do freelance for some while to make enough for an upgrade.

As Gary Vaynerchuk quotes, you need to try 100 different things to figure out what you love, I have been living this thought without even knowing. It seems now I know what I am truely interested in and can do for all of my life, it's code & tech.

### DAY 0

Heyya everyone! I'll be writing & recording my experiences to make a documentation of my life. This is kind of an online diary or journal where I mention all my thoughts & actions. I will be writing a recap for everyday on this blog sometimes I may miss out but will make sure to document every step.   
It will be like a productivity tool for me to keep a track of my life and growth. At the same time, this journal will increase my accountability towards my goals.   
I won't use just this blog for my documentation, I plan to record videos too once I be consistent with this concept.     
Fasten up the bootstraps, it's time for an epic adventure!
