Yay!! Finally completed my second freelance project. As I might have described in my previous posts, I have been freelancing since almost the past 2 months just to afford my system upgrade. I have this intention to focus on making money for a couple of months in order to be free to learn new technologies and work with good people & projects, after this "all-money" period. Now I can say good bye to mundane projects with zero learning and focus my efforts and time on quality projects. Though I need to make a bit more for a laptop, that I would be able to get with the completion of the ecommerce project. The ecommerce site is letting me learn a lot, it is the first time I have to take care of payment gateways too. Shanc is absolutely a phenomenal experience of working on a production level app and getting mentored by someone who is at a position I wanna be.         

This was the project I outsourced (not completely). I did all the scripting/complex features on my own. The freelancers did all the repetitive work and I wrote the code they have to copy & paste. The client paid me immediately after I fixed a couple of bugs. I was awake till almost 1 AM for 3 days as this was their preferred timing. This was an international client (for the first time) so had to use PayPal, with a huge transaction fee. Even after that, the PayPal money is on hold, huh. As I been through the forum, I found it's maybe because I haven't used my account since so long and suddenly got an influx. My PayPal has witnessed no transaction since my fiverr days that is 7-8 months back. I visited the resolution center and submitted a request to review my "On Hold" status. Let's hope for it to be fine in a couple of days.       

Now that this energy-draining/painful/very-less-learning/full-of-repetition type of project is done, I can focus on my quality projects and be sure to choose only of those kinds in future. It feels to kind of come out of survival crisis, though I am not yet settled. Still have to get done with the ecom site ASAP to get the laptop. Will probably start reading again from tomorrow!
