Hey everyone! Think of that feeling when you finally figure out how this particular type of application can be made, exactly what I am experiencing right now. Spent most of my time on the ongoing projects today. Didn't read much, I think would be deep into work for somedays. Though would continue with my 5 pages/1 article read.     

## first principles thinking       

I mentioned about Elon Musk referring to some of his mental models in the DAY 4's post. I` was reluctant to dive deep into them until I get the laptop and start focus on learning so decided with "first principles thinking". It's a popular one.     
It's the best way to reverse engineer things, you boil down complicated problems/concepts into the most basic form and fundamental theories which they are an abstraction of. This way we break them down into basic elements and reassemble them from scratch hence avoiding any false assumptions.       

## what one should look for when joining a startup     

I am glad to find that as my portfolio is filling up with more projects, I am getting a number of job offers on Linkedin. Every other day I find people offering equity to work at their startup orsome stipend to be the kind of the main technical guy there.     

Earlier I used to be very excited seeing such offers but as I am observing the things I am realising that it's of no value to be the CTO so early, other logics are there to debate on this but here's my context. It's so important for anyone at my stage to have a more experienced tech guy at their workplace. Sometimes it could be better to work at a company instead of starting up your own. All I just described is debatable but I have experienced things myself and observed processes happening.       

Plan for tomorrow is to go intense on the current projects and take them near completion!
