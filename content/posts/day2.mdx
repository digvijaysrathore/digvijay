Unlike planned I spent most of the day on TS with React and got no time for the ecommerce project. Though the project which I outsourced is going good and might be ready by tomorrow, client can ask for changes so it will not be all done.    

I didn't conversed about the product I mentioned in day 1's blog. I am working on [Shanc](https://shanc.app). It's not all mine but you can say a bunch of aspiring indie developers working together. The reason why I joined the team despite the decision of freelancing for a few months is to get mentored by [Utkarsh Bhimte](https://twitter.com/BhimteBhaisaab).     

As Paul Graham quotes,
> Work with people you want to become like, because you'll become like whoever you work with.    

and Varun Mayya too suggests to intern for someone who is doing the things you aspire to.    

Shanc's code is in TS as I mentioned last day. It's quite tough for me as I haven't worked on TS yet and that too in React. I had a call with him and we decided that I should code a feature we planned for, earlier I was building just a part of that element in the application. It's good as there will be no risk of miss-communication and difficulty in understanding other's code as I will be alone working on that part. Ultimately, I have delayed a bit but have the opportunity of making this feature the best!      

I missed out my morning read as I woke up very late. I worked till almost 12 the last night which is not good. I read this [article by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) today, where he discussed about two type of schedules, one of managers and the other one of makers. It gave me the perfect solution for scheduling my time. Earlier I used to try to manage time using time boxing (dividing your time in numerous chunks) which is advisable by most of the powerful people in the world but after reading Paul Graham's view on this, I realised I am on the maker category (maker: people who produce things and do creative work like programmers, designers, writers). I am supposed to be focused and maintain a flow for hours. He then describes how a small meeting can break the flow and destroy the momentum.    

Talking about my TS w/ React progression, I didn't liked the Ben Awad video much as he didn't explained things very properly. Switched to another one by [Classed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_C2X1yRRac&t=766s). After some tinkering with it today, I don't feel it's that difficult. It's just that I have to explicitely mention things and write a little more code. Didn't completed much of the Shanc'c task yet.       

# maker's schedule

I have come to the conclusion that -
- I should be spending my day time based on the maker's schedule and the spare night time (probably a 2 hour span) on the manager's schedule.
- I would avoid scheduling any 20 minute tasks during the day time i.e. during the maker time. Would tend to fix all the calls during the night time.
- Would give atleast 2 hours to a particular activity usually coding or learning some new tech.
- Will chop the day in maximum 3 chunks that is doing 3 major tasks.    

Most of my time is spent on learning to code or building something with it so this type of management would work best for me.     

# learnings 

As I mentioned above about a call with Utkarsh, we didn't had all-code discussion. He frequently explains how one should pursue things when building a product.      

So here on Shanc I was pondering upon the placement of a button to toggle a modal. He told me to place it in the simplest way and make it live and then ask the users where it seems most suitable to them. In other words, launch early and ask the users what they want as ultimately the product is meant to serve them. When I was thinking about this IOT idea I had in mind, I strategized for days on what feature to plug in, that was a wrong approach. The better thing would be to keep a minimalist application and ask users about it.     

I am also trying to develop a habit of reading so rather than starting to read a book, I am consuming an article per day, probably a book summary, productivity blog or even a technical read. This way I am able to keep up with my daily habit and not get overwhelmed with the size of book. This way of taking the minimalist step for building a habit is quite good. Source: Atomic Habit.    

For tomorrow, I will dedicate half of my time on the ecom store and the other half on Shanc. I usually set impossible deadlines and feel bad failing their accomplishment. So I will be optimistic to complete the Shanc's task by Sunday (today is thursday) and the ecom site by tuesday of next week. See ya tomorrow!
