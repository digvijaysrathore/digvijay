It's been a month since I stopped journaling. I was stuck in deciding specs for my PC and had some pending projects to complete. 
That's why I am labelling this writing as Day 9. Later, I made a video marking this small win of getting a PC. As of now, I have 
decided to journal as my main stream of content.  Videos will be often uploaded for showing something visually, like the progress 
of some application, code, etc.      

### ML w/ Python

On day 9, I decided to start with Machine Learning and Python as decided months back. I haven't mentioned it anywhere but I have got 
a bit of experience with Python. Back then, I referred to <A target="_blank" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate The Boring Stuff With Python</A>. 
The book goes into in-depth explanations after the first 3 chapters (as much I read). I do think anyone reading can continue with 
their domain after 3 chapters. Additionaly, a few months ago, I tried Django as well and built a pretty good application integrating database, 
rendering static files, etc. So I have got enough basics to learn ML.     

It was quite overwhelming to refer the docs, also I wasn't able to find a proper textual tutorial. I started with a 
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-mP7qA9cagf68V06sko5otr" target="_blank"> playlist on Tech With Tim </A> (Youtube channel).   

I got a decent understanding of what ML is and how these models and algorithms are used after watching the first 4 episodes and I ended up building 
a model to predict student grades based on their past performance. While programming, some things are there which sounds illogical for the 
first time but as I stick with them, things become obvious.   

As guided in the videos, I used <A href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance" target="_blank">UCI's Student Performance Dataset</A>. 
Here's the <A href="https://github.com/digvijaysrathore/student-grades-prediction" >github repository of my ML model</A>.     

Alright, this was my Day 9's progress! See ya.
