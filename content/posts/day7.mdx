In the first half of the day, I tried building something with [11ty](https://11ty.dev), a new static site generator. 11ty basically lets us create a single template to load tons of dynamic data. I just heard about it on twitter and went on to try it. My aim was to build a developer resources site which I can use to navigate anyone who asks for some content recommendation. Similar to a markdown based blog. It took me 3 hours to build.         

[Here's](https://devxresources.netlify.app) ([devxresources.netlify.app](https://devxresources.netlify.app)) what I made, a simple (+ugly) site which has two dummy posts. Will add proper content on some other day. I referred to [11ty's docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) and [Tanay Pratap's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NywYg8i0kc&t=1985s), both are pretty easy to understand and enough to get started.      

I realised that working on some one-day projects on regular basis makes me feel productive and when it's with a new tech, I turn extremely excited to see something working. Learning always make me happy!        

For the other helf of the day, I was working on Shanc & the ecom project. I have got good progress today on both of them. Spent about 1.5 hours on the outsourced project. It's a simple but 140 pages huge html, css & js site. This one is done, just some node js bits were left. Learnt about pair server and nodemailer NPM package. Most probably, will be able to get paid by tomorrow. Super excited!          

Btw, it's been 7 days of me documenting everything on this journal. Loving it!
