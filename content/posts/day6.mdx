I spent major chunck of this day in finalizing my second project (it is about to get done) and sorting out an error in Shanc (though am not able to fix it till now, lol). I like exploring products on [IndieHackers.com](https://www.indiehackers.com/) & [Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com), to be honest I am addicted to binging indie developed products. Noticed something important.      

It is common to think how would any individual compete with giants like Google, MS, Amazon or any other company which has their outlet in all the sectors, like Google Meet for video conferencing, Google Keep for note taking, etc. I was curious to know the take of these successful indie developers on this. As a weekly newletter by IndieHackers.com, I got this article in my inbox which talked about something similar.            

Today, I noticed that most of the top ranked products are not competing but filling the gaps of these giants. They are complimenting them. For example, instead of making a Google Analytics alternative [Shanc](https://shanc.app) is simplifying metrics. Shanc found what's wrong with Google Analytics (it's over complicated dashboard) and built a product on top of it.     

Reinventing the wheel seems cool but it can take years to do so. MNCs spend millions on building their in-house tech and competing with them might be a mistake. The other day Varun Mayya too mentioned this in his Instagram story - "17 year olds will be beating tech giants by building better user experiences, using APIs."              

Most of the companies have open APIs to access their technical solutions like Microsoft Azure has trained their text-to-speech ML models on a huge dataset, it is practically impossible for a small team to do so. Inspite of that, we can use Azure TTS API to use that functionality and serve it with simplicity in our application. Startups like [Play.ht](https://play.ht) are doing it.
