I have been trying to find freelance work since the past 1.5 months since I completed my first internship. Need to make good money, preferably quick (not that patient for it), to upgrade my system so nothing restricts me from learning development & design further. Incredibly interested in gaming and Unreal Engine too and that requires good hardware. Once I get a good machine (PC/Laptop) my growth and passion to learn will never get hindered.   

I am not that highly experienced developer so freelancing is also helping me grow my skills to match with the deadlines and efficiency of the product, I mean freelance projects are often repetitive and it's difficult to find a completely new thing to work on but that's not the case for me. The current projects are tough enough to teach me well and give a taste of something new. I am trying out the easiest and fastest ways to accomplish the website or application with highest quality. Would describe a few things I had to learn for working on my current projects.

*As my first project, I built a blogging website with an admin panel including a rich text editor. Actually, I build it twice. I used MERN for the first one but found the API wasn't really fast and it stucks. I researched a bit and found about headless CMS. Spent some time knowing the available providers and found Stackbit which is like a no-code tool and has awesome templates. Obviously, I used a template and customized the site for my client and now it is blazing fast and has a highly secure admin panel. All build on top of headless CMS.*

So as of now, I have completed only one project and have closed the clients summing up to get a good laptop within the range I have thought of. Currently, working on 3 projects. 

- One of them is a fully fledged ecommerce store with some extra (difficult to implement) features. I decided not to use headless CMS as the client already had designs made in simple html & css and it is nearly impossible for me to convert all those into JSX/React components in order to use Gatsby for headless CMS. So I am using Node JS with EJS to render those html & css templates with dynamic data. So far going good with this approach. Have to deliver the work in two folds, have to prepare the common ecom essentials within the next week and another 7-8 days for that additional feature. Optimistic about it seeing the progress.
- The second one actually not a freelance project but like a paid product building experience. I am working with a team and they are giving me complete time to adapt and learn the stuff I need, to work on the application. I can call it an internship but not that formal. As my first task, I coded a Firebase Function, that was quite easy. As we are using Firebase, major work has to be done on frontend. The catch is the frontend is using TypeScript with React. I have been assigned a FE task and the founder is taking complete care in recommending me content for learning TypeScript w/ React. I plan to deliver the work by tomorrow, still doubt that. Let's see. I am watching a 28 minute tutorial by [Ben Awad on TS in React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5iWr6Srsj8&t=576s), I hope it turns out useful.
- There's another good paying project but I decided to outsource it. The reason being, it involved generating over 100 pages using simple html & css. As I told, freelance projects are letting me learn but this one had very simple code and repetitive tasks. I got a beginner to handle all the basic stuff and I did some design changes. The client already bought a template so again I wasn't able to use Gatsby to generate the pages and I am not that much experienced with Gatsby. In some way, I am being very selective about the things I work on. I am making sure they teach me something and that thing should have potential in future as well. Most of the simple html, css & js stuff will be done on no-code platforms and will be automated so no point competing with machine.

I am confident enought to complete them on time. Will probably avoid any further projects until I complete these. If everything goes well, I would be able to get a laptop doing the above projects.     

Moreover, I am keeping myself productive by maintaining this journal and keeping a track of my tasks. So the next 1 day will be spent on the ecom store and TypeScript. I need to finish up the basics quick to work on the codebase. I think, now we are on the same page. I would continue with daily happenings and learnings tomorrow. Thanks!
