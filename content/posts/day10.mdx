This was quite a productive day. I started learning Unreal Engine 4 from a <A href="https://www.virtushub.com/survival-horror" target="_blank">playlist by Devsquad A.K.A Virtus Hub</A>. 
I got some introductory knowledge from the <A href="https://avalonmeta.com/" target="_blank">Unreal course at Avalon Meta</A> then wanted to continue with the above mentioned playlist. 
Honestly, I was impressed by what Virtus was building at the end.          

I got pretty good progress with the playlist. Got done with 9 videos and I am amazed to see myself getting familarized with the blueprints in UE. Here's how I am strategizing my Unreal 
journey -    
1. Learn UE first, ignore blender for sometime.
2. Use free 3D models available on the web.
3. Learn blueprints instead of C++.
4. The aim is to build games, package & export atleast 1 game within september.        

Pretty simple points I have decided for.       

### Youtube content     
To be honest, I love creating videos much more than these texts. The catch is, I am not sure what to post. The thing is I don't like giving tutorials or advicing something I haven't 
experienced. So after a bit of brainstorming, I have decided to post videos showing all the progress I make visually. Whatever projects I am working on, I will record a clip about their 
current stage. Additionaly, I will try learning new tech while recording my screen and cut them down to biteable content. I do think of coding my next app live. Simple put - 
1. Show the progress of your projects visually.
2. Document the process while you learn.
3. Code apps in long form videos.       

Let's see how it goes. Se ya!
