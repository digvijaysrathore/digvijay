Today I spent most of the time reading and learning non-technical stuff. Was able to work only on the ecommerce site but glad to know about the theories I read about. As a result of following the schedule in a nice manner on DAY 3 I woke on time after proper sleep so I do think my management seems to work.         

## today's read - Elon Musk By Ashlee Vance & Mental Models (by fs.blog)     

This is a book I have been trying to find time for, since the start of the lockdown, I am all focused on saving for my laptop so ignored good reads in stupidity. Today, picked it up and started reading it again. Just read 5 pages.          

[Charlie Munger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger) in one of his speech mentioned about something called Mental Models. It's like a framework for thinking, a bunch of tools for anyone to process information, see it in context with the problem and figure out solutions.        

I went on to research about it and found that not just Charlie Munger but a lot of powerful personalities use Mental Models. Elon Musk himself have talked about some of his Mental Models in interviews like [first thinking principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV3sBlRgzTI). I was wonder stuck.       

Found a bunch of books people have wrote on building & implementing mental models. I desperately wanna read them but, you might not get the feeling but I am not in the right state until I manage to get a laptop.   

Still I thought I should research more about them and [found an article on fs.blog](https://fs.blog/mental-models/). Must say, it explained what & how to create mental models so well. Earlier I used to think, subjects taught at school are of no use in real life but after reading this article I was able to connect the dots about how Elon uses physics principles to solve problems and how subjects like maths & physics are considered to build a foundation for brain to learn to think. The article describes several other concepts of physics, chemistry, biology and maths which can be used as mental models to solve problems. Now I am realising that the problem isn't with subject, it's with the way they are taught and intention or anything for that matter.      

One thing I realised after working with some experienced people and doing an internship, in the initial phases of our career we always need someone who can personally mentor us. That's like the most important perk to be offered to interns. After the freelance thing I would try to work where I get much more experienced people who are ready to mentor instead of where I am considered the most intelligent. I would like to be called most enthusisastic rather than smartest.      

Overall, because of so many things I learned today and the growing interest towards reading, I would say I had a productive day. Well, didn't do much of the work. See ya!
